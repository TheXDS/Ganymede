# About Ganymede

Ganymede is an MVVM framework that intends to provide of a set of abstracted services commonly used when developing apps for different platforms. While this is a very early alpha package, it's been developed enough to experiment and create simple apps that leverage the underlying technology of it to be able to manage and resolve ViewModels to Views automatically, also providing of a navigation model and dialog services.

The API is somewhat stable as of version 0.3.x, and will mostly get incremental changes (adding new features, while keeping previously implemented functionality largely the same). This means that the eventual 1.0 release will look simmilar to the current state of the project.
