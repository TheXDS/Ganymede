# Ganymede WPF bindings

This library includes a Ganymede implementation tailored to Windows Presentation Framework. It comes bundled with a custom theme for some controls, and a special dialog subsystem that integrates to an application as an overlay.

A few `Window` class extensions are also included, with support for titlebar customization and acrylic background.
